<p id="375bf749-c20b-40b6-96c9-f339c92a0cf5" class="">What makes you happy? The million dollar question with million different answers. Obviously, there is no one right answer to this. Happiness depends on one's priorities, upbringing, perception towards life, culture, surrounding and many more. On top of that it is the function of time. The things that made you happy yesterday don't do today and vice versa. Which naturally means your sources of happiness are no longer valid tomorrow. You need to find new source of happiness. Worst of all, this changes so fast that most people find it difficult to keep up. But, is there one thing that makes you constantly happy no matter the time or circumstances? I think there is. it might differ from person to person but I believe every person has one constant source of happiness throughout their life.</p>
<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="9b090b7e-ed9a-457f-afa9-d6847b9924c2" class="">Then what makes me happy? Short and honest answer is "Whenever I feel I have contributed to other people's happiness". It increases even more if these people are unknown to me. Normally you don&rsquo;t know what makes you happy until you somehow do it and then only you look back and realise how happy it made you.</p>
<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="cb6791ae-239c-4826-9159-b865baafc477" class="">I will start with a little background on what led to my pursuit of happiness. I am extremely blessed in my life. I have got everything that I wanted. I was very obedient child, good at studies, married the love of my life, had very successful career so far and had success that surprised many people. Every now and then I wonder why am I constantly getting everything I want? I hear many people complaining about their life. There are many friends of mine, as talented as me, some even more, and yet life has not been fair to them. So what makes me so special? The only answer I can think of is I am blessed with some eternal power. As crazy and irrational as it sounds, this is what I want to believe in. I grew up in a very religious family with constant religious events. I used to be science and engineering student and yet I believe in god (feel free to judge me). So, since god has been so kind to me, what have I done from my part? Am I being grateful? Should I repay god back? I thought I should put some efforts from my side too, and I decided to go with my expertise. I am a software engineer and I specialise in mobile app development (both Android and iOS). I decided of developing an app for religious purpose where users can read religious books, articles, listen to religious songs and so on.</p>

<p id="1e05a0b8-5716-4549-b664-0aaa47ab537e" class="">It took me few months to completely build for both platforms. This was completely free with no intention to earn money whatsoever. I invested fair bit of time but that was okay because I love developing apps and this was for a noble cause. It took some time to get traction but slowly people started downloading it. To be honest, I didn't expect anything out of it. I developed an app, published to the store and let user download and use it, end of the story. I thought, if any day god asks me what I have done in return, I would open the play / app store and show the app.</p>

<p id="c31a9a2a-6899-4fba-9b3a-0b5555c67858" class="">Days past by, months past and suddenly I started getting feedback email form the user of the app. This is where my utmost happiness lies. Over the period of last few months, I have got such heart warning and emotional emails that I could read over again and again for the rest of my life. These people are no one to me. I don't know who they are, where exactly they live, what their names are but yet their messages give me so much warmth.</p>
<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="bd271a22-fdfb-40fa-9c0a-bb52fc58c79d" class="">A man from Pune, India said he has been able to complete reading of whole Kuljam Swaroop (the religious book in the app) twice entirely from the app. A father from somewhere in India said, his daughter aged 10 years has now memorised full "meher sager" because of the app. He said she would not have learnt that otherwise since she always plays with her tablet. A guy from Nepal sent me the message which literally said I brought Rajji back to his life. He used to do sewa puja every day in front of the actual "Swaroop Saheb". He had to migrate to Dubai for living and he could not take "Swaroop Saheb" with him. He felt trrrible and for 1 and half years he never did sewa puja, neither he was able to read any vaani. After he found this app in play store, he said he opens the app and does sewa puja in front of the app every mornings and evenings. An old grandpa from the USA said he knew more actual and meaningful things about religion and god through this app than from the learning of his entire life. Since the app has books with translation, no he no longer has to depend of &ldquo;experts&rdquo; to explain his god or religion. He is so glad that he got access to this app at the &ldquo;last days&rdquo; of his life.</p>
<p id="1ea8639f-1e5c-4be5-82f5-c550874611e6" class="">Now, if these messages don&rsquo;t give you chills, I don't know what else will.</p>
<p id="42f60fa4-a090-430e-9d98-5eecf0ca28f8" class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="1e7910bb-df02-4b3a-b39e-f4b051b2c11c" class="">There are so many other examples as such. I receive countless wishes, blessings and luck from little kids who just started using mobile app to students who are away from home for studies, to very old grandparents whose only reason to use smartphone is this App.</p>
<p id="2afa05e0-7d96-439d-a5b5-caf4a1131f32" class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="305aceae-f633-4186-82a3-bec089f423b9" class="">I have done many good things in my life and will probably do many more. But as of now, this is the proudest of things I have done till date. If I have only few minutes to live, I will spend every of those minutes thinking about the app I built and all those messages people sent to me. I can die in peace with smile on my face. Some of these messages might be fake, some are probably just being nice to me or even exaggeration, but I wouldn&rsquo;t care because this is my pursuit of happYness.</p>
